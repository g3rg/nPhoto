GUI application that allows tagging and commenting of photos, with a focus on being fast and lightweight and to 
run on netbooks (maybe tablets?), and then at the end of the trip (or day if a professional?) to export to LightRoom 
or other software on beefier system.


Components:

[ ] Import - given a source folder, copy to a new folder in a 'managed' area, verify file copied
[ ] Review - browse photos (JPEG Thumbnail?), tag photos (IPTC keywords? for JPG, ? for RAW), 
	comments (JPEG Comments, ? for RAW), view EXIF etc, delete!, autorotate based on EXIF data,
	
[ ] Backup - copy all info to X different locations!
[ ] Export - Lightroom - should hopefully just be copy library to a folder?




RESEARCH:
FastStone Imageviewer (Freeware/donationware for non comercial) 
EXIFToolGUI.
Image Ingester
PhotoMechanic 
Adobe DNG Converter? - encapsulates metadata without resorting to sidecar files for CR2
